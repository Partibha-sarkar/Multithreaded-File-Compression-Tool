#DISCRIPTION

This project implements a multithreaded Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm in C++ for efficient file compression and decompression.
By splitting the input data into two chunks and processing them in parallel using C++ threads, it significantly reduces execution time compared to a single-threaded approach.

ðŸš€ Features

Compression using Run-Length Encoding (RLE)

Decompression to restore the original file

Multithreaded processing for faster execution

Time measurement to compare performance
